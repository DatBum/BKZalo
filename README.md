This is my 3rd Project about Network Programming at University
- I made a application that run on Android phone and base on client-server model. 
- I haven't used authentication yet so you can easily create new account and you can chat or send image (by directly take a picture or pick
from your device) to other accounts.
- I used Firebase as my database so you can see all the accounts that I have created. In case you want to use your own Firebase account, 
I've already made an instruction for that in Instruction.docx (Updated: I also give instructions about how to install my project on mobile 
phone)
